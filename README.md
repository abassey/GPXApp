# GPXApp, CIS2750F19

We were tasked to create a GPX Application, which would display files, routes and tracks within those files and rename them, creat new files, add routes to pre-existing files and view all routes andbtracks between a desired path. We were also asked to incorporate database functionality to allow the user store all files, clear all data, and perform some queries. 

A1 and A2 are for the C parser, A3 has the Web UI and A4 has the Web UI + Database. Below is a demo of the whole application working together.
